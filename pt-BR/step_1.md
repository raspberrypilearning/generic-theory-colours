The colour of an object depends on the colour of the light that it reflects or emits. Light can have different wavelengths, and the colour of light depends on the wavelength it has. The colour of light according to its wavelength can be seen in the diagram below. You might recognise this as the colours of the rainbow.

Humans see colour because of special cells in our eyes. These cells are called *cones*. We have three types of cone cells, and each type detects either red, blue, or green light. Therefore all the colours that we see are just mixtures of the colours red, blue, and green.

![Additive colour mixing](images/additive-colour-mixing.png)

In additive colour mixing, three colours (red, green, and blue) are used to make other colours. In the image above, there are three spotlights of equal brightness, one for each colour. In the absence of any colour the result is black. If all three colours are mixed, the result is white. When red and green combine, the result is yellow. When red and blue combine, the result is magenta. When blue and green combine, the result is cyan. It's possible to make even more colours than this by varying the brightness of the three original colours used.

Computers store everything as 1s and 0s. These 1s and 0s are often organised into sets of 8, called **bytes**.

A single byte can represent any number from 0 up to 255.

When we want to represent a colour in a computer program, we can do this by defining the amounts of red, blue, and green that make up that colour. These amounts are usually stored as a single byte and therefore as a number between 0 and 255.

Here's a table showing some colour values:

| Vermelho | Verde | Azul | Colour   |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| 255      | 0     | 0    | Vermelho |
| 0        | 255   | 0    | Verde    |
| 0        | 0     | 255  | Azul     |
| 255      | 255   | 0    | Amarelo  |
| 255      | 0     | 255  | Magenta  |
| 0        | 255   | 255  | Cyan     |
