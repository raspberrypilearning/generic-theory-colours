The colour of an object depends on the colour of the light that it reflects or emits. Light can have different wavelengths, and the colour of light depends on wavelength it has. The colour of light according to its wavelength can be seen in the diagram below. You might recognise this as the colours of the rainbow.

Humans see colour because of special cells in their eyes. These cells are called *cones*. We have three types of cone cells and each type detects either red, blue, or green light. Therefore all the colours that we see are just mixtures of the colours red, blue, and green.

Computers store everything as 1s and 0s. These 1s and 0s are often organised into sets of 8, called **bytes**.

*[byte]: A set of 8 bits, for example 10011001

A single byte can represent any number from 0 up to 255.

When we want to represent a colour in a omputer program, we can do this by defining the amounts of red, blue, and green that make up that colour. These amounts are usually stored as a single byte and therefore as a number between 0 and 255.

Here's a table showing some colour values:

| Red | Green | Blue | Colour    |
|-----|-------|------|-----------|
| 255 |     0 |    0 | Red       |
|   0 |   255 |    0 | Green     |
|   0 |     0 |  255 | Blue      |
| 255 |   255 |    0 | Yellow    |
| 255 |    10 |  180 | Hot Pink  |
| 210 |   105 |   30 | Chocolate |
